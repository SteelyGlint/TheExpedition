court_visit.20 - fill in options for AI, rebalance chances for reaction emotions



court_visit 20/30 - possibly should only have one "interest" for each AI, satisfied with a flag?

court_visit.30 - change some treatises to not give a "traveller_bad" flag


try bouncing off cv.20 with "nothing changed" flag in treatise menu to get rid of liege portrait?

add province modifiers for recent court visit, expelled/outlawed

visit should eventually get cut off after a certain number of interactions

try replacing is_variable checks in interest treatise options with pair of check_variables

improved chances of meeting with a character with a positive disposition






Thought to be done:
finish court_visit.36 (awestruck liege)
deal with targ_meet/targ_liege being imprisoned or incapable
make sure you only get the awestruck event with kings
court_visit.30 - option to just sway with diplomacy
script events for grateful, impressed, delighted, awestruck, enraged, terrified, contempt

court_visit.30 - actual effects for showing AIs treatises they're interested in
