duel of wits with ruler's councilor
*compares appropriate skill between the two characters
*councilor traits determine how he treats the traveller and whether or not he recommends to the liege
*may consider traveller a foreign threat to his own job, incompetent, or a potential ally


things a king might grant:
-raising to nobility (could also be gained by "upjumping" and simply taking a county)
-betrothal/marriage to a relative
-gunpowder components: sulfur (brimstone), saltpeter (niter)
-tool steel ores: tungsten, chromium, manganese
-fame and reputation as miracle worker/learned man
-if vassalized: a special title with extra prestige/money, a newly constructed castle


courtiers/councilors may consider certain ideas heretical, especially with certain traits (both traveller and king/courtier?)

in many cases, both the king and the appropriate councilor will gain tech points
