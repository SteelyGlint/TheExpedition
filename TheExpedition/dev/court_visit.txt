planting trees in whose shade you will never sit


indifferent: [name] seems indifferent towards you. Perhaps [subjpronoun] considers you just another one of the many supplicants and foreigners demanding an audience at court.

suspicious: [name] eyes you suspiciously. Your sins could be catching up to you or may have simply gotten off on the wrong foot, but [name] seems to be less than cordial. [capsubjpronoun] distrust will make your job more difficult.

curious: [name] is interested in what you have to say, and curious about the knowledge you possess. Your positive reputation seems to make [name] more inclined to treat your words favorably, and give them the attention they deserve.

cold: [name] greets you coldly, and quickly makes it clear that you are not welcome. 




enraged: [name] is enraged, and shouts that you are a wicked heretical criminal who does not deserve the protection of the law. The guards draw their weapons on [posspronoun] order to seize you.

scared: [name] seems terrified of you. With wide eyes, [subjpronoun] orders you removed from court. Men-at-arms warily escort you from the premises, apparently reluctant to get close to you.

contempt: [name] reacts contemptuously to you. [capsubjpronoun] calls your ideas foolish nonsense, and you a bumbling foreign fool. You suspect that [subjpronoun] has ulterior motives for [posspronoun] reaction. [name] asks you to leave without wasting more of [posspronoun] precious time.

annoyed: [name] seems annoyed by you. It's hard to tell whether you made an etiquette mistake, revealed a bit of unsettling information, or if it's something outside your control. Whatever the case may be, [name] is unimpressed and it will be more difficult to win [objpronoun] over.

demanding: [name] 




impressed: [name] is impressed by you and the knowledge you possess. [capsubjpronoun] inquires about commissioning a copy of one of your treatises, along with your aid in understanding some of the foreign ideas contained within.

[vassal only]
delighted: [name] is delighted by the knowledge you have presented and has taken a shine to you personally. [capsubjpronoun] offers you an immediate honorarium plus an audience with [liege]. 

[liege only]
awestruck: [name] is absolutely awestruck. You can already see the wheels turning in [posspronoun] head, imagining how [subjpronoun] can use you to expand and enrich the realm.\n\nAfter briefly conferring with [posspronoun] councilors, [name] offers you a place in [posspronoun] court if you swear fealty to [objpronoun]. You will receive a distinguished title at court and possibly a council seat in an area of your expertise. Serve [objpronoun] well and [subjpronoun] may grant you boons, raise you to nobility, or reward you with a landed title.

duel of wits with ruler's councilor
*compares appropriate skill between the two characters
*councilor traits determine how he treats the traveller and whether or not he recommends to the liege
*may consider traveller a foreign threat to his own job, incompetent, or a potential ally


things a king might grant:
-raising to nobility (could also be gained by "upjumping" and simply taking a county)
-betrothal/marriage to a relative
-gunpowder components: sulfur (brimstone), saltpeter (niter)
-tool steel ores: tungsten, chromium, manganese
-fame and reputation as miracle worker/learned man
-if vassalized: a special title with extra prestige/money, a newly constructed castle

in many cases, both the king and the appropriate councilor will gain tech points

-modern strategic board games (chess, go, stratego)
