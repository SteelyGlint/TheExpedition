time traveller mod: an American mad scientist travels back in time to medieval Europe
-"crash landing" events at the beginning of a new game... you can't go back, choose what stuff to save

the time traveller possesses a barony level holding similar to a patrician palace, and a titular count title (if necessary)
-unique "modern education" trait? modern nutrition?

gameplay divided into two sections, wandering and landed
in the wandering section, the player moves to various courts (or provinces?)
-learning about medieval politics and culture is important
	*may become Catholic/Jewish/etc. to fit in, or at least be able to fake it
	*certain stats will be secretly tracked: court visits, people met, warfare seen, trades, study time
	*start off with character modifiers that apply big penalties to skills, reflecting ignorance of medieval world
		!these modifiers change which events can occur while wandering, particularly learning the local language
	*diplomacy: medieval etiquette, common languages
		!learn the local language while wandering (more people met decreases MTTH)
		!visiting many courts may eventually grant you mastery of medieval etiquette
		!after years of immersion, you know many dialects and your accent is mostly gone (+1 dip)
	*martial: medieval warfare (discipline, siegecraft, logistics)
		!witness battle/siege occurring in the same province
		!you are at risk of being thought a spy for being near a battle
		!meet refugees, deserters, camp followers from battle in adjacent province
		!choose whether to train in medieval combat, or simply rely on a firearm
		!mastery of medieval logistics, after witnessing/fighting sufficient battles
	*stewardship: medieval mercantile practices
		!haggle with a merchant, possibly teaching important lessons about medieval negotiation as you get swindled
		!interact with traders in a merchant republic or trade post
		!observe the work of the stewards of various courts, how medieval administration functions
		!synthesize modern economic ideas with medieval experiences (+1 stew)
	*intrigue: court politics
		!begin understanding the roles you and others play at court
		!scheming and intrigue are witnessed, while visiting a court (after visiting sufficiently many)
		!participating in plots or factions could eventually grant mastery of court intrigue
		!successful plot to kill someone, joke about cut-throat politics (+1 int)
	*learning: scholarly languages (Latin, Greek, Arabic), theological discourse
		!event/decision to study scholarly languages, becoming more fluent
		!meet or study with a pilgrim/theologian/scholar
		!visit to a monastic school or university
		!gain a better grasp of medieval law
		!discuss medicine with a chirurgeon, you probably know a lot more but still learn (+1 lrn)
		!erudite discussion with high learning theologian cements mastery of medieval scholarship
		!exposure to foreign cultures and religions picks up Greek/Arabic/Aramaic (+1 lrn)
	*making gaffes or running afoul of court intrigue might create enemies, requiring the character to flee
-attempt to acquire resources needed to rebuild components of the "time lab"
	*various metals, sulphur/saltpeter, primitive fuel oils
	*traveller could leverage modern knowledge to make himself useful to liege or others in the realm
	*if moving between courts, perhaps a bit of mercantile buy low/sell high?
	*character at risk of high-tech gear being interpreted as sorcery, or modern ideas considered heretical
-gathering trustworthy followers (courtiers) could be important, especially ones with high skills
	*some followers may be agents sent by jealous rivals, powerful kings, or even the pope
	*need a lot of interaction events with followers (telling them the truth, converting them to your culture/religion)
	*create possible followers when visiting courts, or out in the countryside
	*hedge knight, pagan warrior, veteran soldier, siege engineer, hunter (surprise female version of some of these?)
	*scholar, minstrel, pilgrim, metalworker, merchant(foreign?), astronomer, barmaid, prostitute, merc footpad (m/f)?
	*street urchin (m/f), runaway squire, bright apprentice, farmer's daughter, crippled beggar (m/f)
-in certain places, a decision to hire ships
	*allow you to move across the english channel or other small bodies of water
	*might just move you straight to a specific province (a delay might cause problems, probably easier to just be instant)

spend time at the workshop (alternative to wandering)
-heal wounds, remove maimed trait as long as medical supplies are available
-engage in conversation with followers, possibly a slower way to gain trav_interaction points
-earn gold by event if certain buildings are constructed in workshop (distillery?)
-gain new courtiers/followers if certain buildings are constructed (medical school?)
-study latin, theology, law, etc.
-write treatises on topics you have modern knowledge about (with aid of laptop/manuals)
-construct facilities or items that require modern knowledge (at least accelerate construction?)

Traits:
Modern Education	education trait possessed by the time traveller, requires American culture? possibly unique?
Scientist/Engineer	a lifestyle trait for the traveller, acquired by studying in the time lab library
Descendant			needs more evocative name, descended (male lineage?) from the original traveller
Alumnus				graduate from University Society
?					monk-equivalent trait that disinherits possessor, when joining an order
?					if possible, apply a trait (or char mod) to select next captain of order
Armed (4x)			education style trait set describing how well armed the character is (simplify to 2?)
	level 1			primitive medieval-produced musket/arquebus fired with black powder
	level 2			advanced medieval-produced rifle with smokeless cartridge ammunition
	level 3			firearm manufactured in the time lab workshop, with advanced machine tools
	level 4			firearm brought from the future

Technology
Metallurgy and Firearms (global troop offensive/defensive, higher tiers allow special firearm troops)
Agriculture and Medicine (increased tax revenue, reduced disease spread)
Literacy and Printing (faster technology spread and gain, possibly increased revolt risk)
Future Ideas and Philosophy (combat tactics)

Special Units
*primitive firearms could just boost effectiveness of infantry from province, doesn't need special troops
gunpowder - elite soldiers armed with advanced firearms, often mounted
Bombardiers - support troops manning bombards for use as siege weapons or artillery

Combat Tactics (restricted by American culture? or merely to units with lots of gunmen?)
Guerilla Tactics	(defensive, skirmish) ++gunpowder, +archers, +light_cav, +light_inf
Kill Zone			(stand fast, skirmish, change to melee) +++gunpowder, ++bombard, +archers, +pikemen, +heavy_inf
Breakthrough		(charge, melee) ++gunpowder, ++heavy_cav, ++horse_archers, -pikemen
Fire and Motion		(advance, melee) +++gunpowder, +heavy_inf, +light_cav
Infantry Square		(stand fast, melee) ++gunpowder, ++bombard, ++pikemen, +archers, -cavalry 
Disengage			(defensive, melee, change to skirmish) ++gunpowder, ++light_cav, +archers

at some point, the traveller attempts to acquire a landed title
-could be from serving his liege well, allowing him to request or be offered a county
	*various conditions must be met: liege with a high opinion of the traveller and land to give away, certain liege traits, etc.
	*performing high-tech "miracles" on behalf of the liege may speed this process up
	*may cause turmoil in the realm, as a foreigner with strange ideas is raised to the nobility
-the traveller could simply declare war on a weak realm, seizing a single county
	*traveller needs a lot of money for mercenaries, or a large retinue equipped with firearms
	*current liege likely to object if the target is within his realm, though a favored traveller might get away with it
	*liege may attempt to stop the war, even if it's against a non-vassal?

	
the workshop is the traveller's barony holding, which contains a number of high-tech "buildings"
-the source of many of the traveller's unique abilities
-some early buildings can be built very quickly, if the right items are at hand (generator)
-perhaps some advanced tech only be built outside the lab (i.e. if a landed title is also owned, could be destroyed in sieges)
-a medical bay, for healing injury/disease, improving health, and possibly reducing biological age
-a genetics lab, for applying beneficial genetic traits to offspring, possibly biowarfare
-a metallurgical workshop, for refining metals, improved weapons and armor for troops, prerequisite for other workshops?
-a mechanical workshop, for producing tools and machinery, includes lathe/cutters/extruders/drills/rollers/etc.
-an armory, for constructing firearms for advanced retinues (musketeers, gunpowder, sappers, cannons?)
-power generation, coal/wood fired boiler? water power? diesel running on whale/olive oil?
-library (electronic?), for storing a vast amount of modern knowledge, gains lots of tech points?
-agriculture lab, seed bank, modern crops and farming techniques
-communications, radio transmitters (a very limited number?) could allow a large demesne size
-historical mineral surveys/geological info, for long-term wealth generation

workshop building tree [most advanced buildings require the workshop no longer be hidden]
generator (requires generator, consumes parts to keep running)
	wind/water/coal dynamo (requires mechanical)
		electrification (requires smelter)
			illumination (requires laboratory, glassworks, precision machine shop)
aqueduct/sewer
	indoor plumbing (requires smelter, mechanical)
		water treatment (requires laboratory)

[removed] defensive bombards (requires arsenal)

possible extras:
deal with manuals as a cost to various things at some point, maybe by complicated events
*add to a variable with each building constructed, compare against total manuals (create manuals slowly)
add restrictions to certain buildings based on starting no_* character modifiers (society, library, drill)
add the "real landed title" restriction to many buildings
try to make workshop de jure capital of a county

high tier buildings can construct certain goods by event/decision when at workshop?
perhaps a rare event to use a low tier workshop to build tools(etc.) out of multiple parts
laboratory: medicine
machine shop (costs a part): tool, generator
laboratory + machine shop (costs a part): gun
precision machine shop: tool, part
laboratory + precision machine shop: gun, radio (costs a part)
printing press (needs computer too, and power): manuals


a new stage of the game begins once the traveller gains a landed title
-wandering should be restricted or removed
	*could be a regency while wandering
	*could send agents rather than wandering personally
-if perceived to be an evil sorcerer, may face political or military consequences
	*liege or rival vassals may take political action against you
	*possibly some sort of special CB against you under specific circumstances
	*pope might excommunicate you, or call crusade against you
-establish a unique form of government, informed by modern ideas
	*would need to be a king or duke, with certain other requirements met
	*perhaps some form of autocratic, centralized merchant republic? no trade posts? designated heir?
	*possibly some way to discourage packing the whole country with your own dynasty?
	*county/duke titles appointed and revoked freely? events to make vassals into patricians somehow?
		!designate vassal with minor title, then destroy patrician and replace with designated vassal
		!event where vassal wishes to be raised to patrician, when a patrician house isn't landed
		!free_revoke_on_governments (feudal, tribal, nomad?)
	*certain decisions must be voted on by the other families
		!a crown law determines which decisions that other families get to vote on
		!limit aggressive wars, start a special type of war, declare vassal enemy of the state
		!establishing "orders" could require a vote?
	*a realm-wide "vote of no confidence" in the top liege can attempt to force him to abdicate
		!triggered by tyranny, known_murderer, and various bad traits
		!a period of campaigning and debate before the actual vote is tallied
		!if the vote succeeds, king can refuse to abdicate at the cost of additional tyranny (and civil war?)
		!refusal could unlock an additional faction that demands abdication
		!leader (or participants/voters?) of the vote might be vulnerable to punishment if the vote fails
-establish a unique new religion
	*probably a catholic heresy, or messianic jewish heresy
		-different possible religions that could be founded, with different qualities
		-depends on whether the traveller founds it or a descendant of his founds it
			!aggressive, traveller as final prophet, founder conquers on behalf of God as conservator of Earth
			!tolerant, no religious head (or not the secular ruler), learning bonus, affinity for university society
			!mystery cult, rituals and secret knowledge, control "tools of God", remain catholic (try to control pope?)
			!messianic, traveller was Christ (averted apoc by dying?), living people he met might convert, founder is head
			!pure cult of personality, wholly new religion discards many Christian rites in favor of "the leader"
	*reveres the original traveller as a saint, miracle worker, or even as Christ come again?
		-possibly some regard traveller as saint and some as divine, the important thing is that his authority supercedes the pope
	*founder could gain religious head title, "crusades" activated with certain conditions (religion size, MA?)
-establish various "orders" which take the form of vassal holy orders/mercenaries, and provide various advantages
	*if possible, the ability to appoint courtiers to head the orders, or at least generate appropriate traits
	*could involve a related minor title or trait for your subjects, similar to kingsguard
	*each order has unique requirements, probably including new govt/religion to be formed
		!requires a courtier of American culture and high skill to set as initial captain
		!could require empty holding slots (in certain province(s)) in which to build a castle/city?
	*possible to send non-landed children (relatives?) to various orders, or they can request opportunity to join
		!returning children may gain traits, improve education, friend/rival/lover, or have other outcomes
		!possible event where (non-heir?) courtier in an order seizes control of it (gains monk-equivalent trait?)
		!some children may wish to remain at the holy order permanently, or do repeated stints
	*a security/intelligence agency, informed by modern statecraft ideas
		!a holy order focused on intrigue and/or martial skill (builds castles)
		!events related to assassination, imprisonment (rescuing?), fabricating treason, purging state enemies
		!also used to defend against plots and other time travellers, serves as inquisitors and spies
		!crown law determines what tools are available to the liege
	*a university society, established to preserve, interpret, and diffuse knowledge (especially future knowledge)
		!a holy order focused on learning and enlightenment values (builds cities)
		!grants the Alumnus trait to a character that succeeds in his studies, with many possible outcomes
		!become cynical, assimilate to American culture, to custom religion, to Christian heresy, expelled or fail
		!crown law of liege changes society: foreigners?, all Christian?, nobles only?, intellectual independence? assimilation?
		!possibly a "cynical" counterweight to the zealous religious head (probably the player)
		!possibly Deism (or another "highly tolerant" faith) as a Catholic heresy activated when the society is founded?
		!events related to spreading technology, tolerance, literacy, preserving future tech, question wisdom of spreading tech
	*a banking order, established to audit vassals and provide moneylending services
		!a holy order, focused on stewardship (doesn't have holdings?)
		!tasked with supervising trade, and acquiring raw materials for workshops?
		!keeps pilgrims and other travellers safe on the roads
		!possibly some form of postal service and road maintenance as well
	*a diplomatic order, established to manage relations with neighboring realms
		!maybe a "media" order? printing press?
	*cartographic/mercantile order?
	*judicial order
	*manufacturing/workshop
.

(1) adoption of philosophical (mathematical-historical) reason as the only and exclusive criterion of what is true;
(2) rejection of all supernatural agency, magic, disembodied spirits, and divine providence;
(3) equality of all mankind (racial and sexual);
(4) secular ‘universalism’ in ethics anchored in equality and chiefly stressing equity, justice, and charity;
(5) comprehensive toleration and freedom of thought based on independent critical thinking;
(6) personal liberty of lifestyle and sexual conduct between consenting adults;
(7) freedom of expression, political criticism, and the press, in the public sphere.
(8) democratic republicanism as the most legitimate form of politics.


technologies that may spread
-the traveller can sell caches of firearms, which can be used by feudal rulers to raise a single musketeer retinue

-modern or new world crops: corn, potatoes, tomatoes
-sanitation/germ theory, water purification
-improved steel smelting techniques
