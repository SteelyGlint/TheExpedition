time traveller mod: an American mad scientist travels back in time to medieval Europe
-"crash landing" events at the beginning of a new game... you can't go back, choose what stuff to save

the time traveller possesses a barony level holding similar to a patrician palace, and a titular count title (if necessary)
-unique "modern education" trait? modern nutrition?

gameplay divided into two sections, wandering and landed
in the wandering section, the player moves to various courts (or provinces?)
-learning about medieval politics and culture is important
	*Catholic to fit in, or at least be able to fake it
	*certain stats will be secretly tracked: court visits, people met, warfare seen, trades, study time
	*start off with character modifiers that apply big penalties to skills, reflecting ignorance of medieval world
		!these modifiers change which events can occur while wandering, particularly learning the local language
	*diplomacy: medieval etiquette, common languages
		!learn the local language while wandering (more people met decreases MTTH)
		!visiting many courts may eventually grant you mastery of medieval etiquette
		!after years of immersion, you know many dialects and your accent is mostly gone (+1 dip)
	*martial: medieval warfare (discipline, siegecraft, logistics)
		!witness battle/siege occurring in the same province
		!you are at risk of being thought a spy for being near a battle
		!meet refugees, deserters, camp followers from battle in adjacent province
		!choose whether to train in medieval combat, or simply rely on a firearm
		!mastery of medieval logistics, after witnessing/fighting sufficient battles
	*stewardship: medieval mercantile practices
		!haggle with a merchant, possibly teaching important lessons about medieval negotiation as you get swindled
		!interact with traders in a merchant republic or trade post
		!observe the work of the stewards of various courts, how medieval administration functions
		!synthesize modern economic ideas with medieval experiences (+1 stew)
	*intrigue: court politics
		!begin understanding the roles you and others play at court
		!scheming and intrigue are witnessed, while visiting a court (after visiting sufficiently many)
		!participating in plots or factions could eventually grant mastery of court intrigue
		!successful plot to kill someone, joke about cut-throat politics (+1 int)
	*learning: scholarly languages (Latin, Greek, Arabic), theological discourse
		!event/decision to study scholarly languages, becoming more fluent
		!meet or study with a pilgrim/theologian/scholar
		!visit to a monastic school or university
		!gain a better grasp of medieval law
		!discuss medicine with a chirurgeon, you probably know a lot more but still learn (+1 lrn)
		!erudite discussion with high learning theologian cements mastery of medieval scholarship
		!exposure to foreign cultures and religions picks up Greek/Arabic/Aramaic (+1 lrn)
	*making gaffes or running afoul of court intrigue might create enemies, requiring the character to flee
-attempt to acquire resources needed to rebuild components of the "time lab"
	*various metals, sulphur/saltpeter, primitive fuel oils
	*traveller could leverage modern knowledge to make himself useful to liege or others in the realm
	*if moving between courts, perhaps a bit of mercantile buy low/sell high?
	*character at risk of high-tech gear being interpreted as sorcery, or modern ideas considered heretical
-gathering trustworthy followers (courtiers) could be important, especially ones with high skills
	*some followers may be agents sent by jealous rivals, powerful kings, or even the pope
	*need a lot of interaction events with followers (telling them the truth, converting them to your culture/religion)
	*create possible followers when visiting courts, or out in the countryside
	*hedge knight, pagan warrior, veteran soldier, siege engineer, hunter (surprise female version of some of these?)
	*scholar, minstrel, pilgrim, metalworker, merchant(foreign?), astronomer, barmaid, prostitute, merc footpad (m/f)?
	*street urchin (m/f), runaway squire, bright apprentice, farmer's daughter, crippled beggar (m/f)
-in certain places, a decision to hire ships
	*allow you to move across the english channel or other small bodies of water
	*might just move you straight to a specific province (a delay might cause problems, probably easier to just be instant)

spend time at the workshop (alternative to wandering)
-heal wounds, remove maimed trait as long as medical supplies are available
-engage in conversation with followers, possibly a slower way to gain trav_interaction points
-earn gold by event if certain buildings are constructed in workshop (distillery?)
-gain new courtiers/followers if certain buildings are constructed (medical school?)
-study latin, theology, law, etc.
-write treatises on topics you have modern knowledge about (with aid of laptop/manuals)
-construct facilities or items that require modern knowledge (at least accelerate construction?)

Traits:
Modern Education	education trait possessed by the time traveller, requires American culture? possibly unique?
Wanderer			deny marriage until landed, but still can have lovers and bastards
Scientist/Engineer	a lifestyle trait for the traveller, acquired by studying in the time lab library
Descendant			needs more evocative name, descended (male lineage?) from the original traveller
Alumnus				graduate from University Society
?					monk-equivalent trait that disinherits possessor, when joining an order
?					if possible, apply a trait (or char mod) to select next captain of order
Armed (4x)			education style trait set describing how well armed the character is (simplify to 2?)
	level 1			primitive medieval-produced musket/arquebus fired with black powder
	level 2			advanced medieval-produced rifle with smokeless cartridge ammunition
	level 3			firearm manufactured in the time lab workshop, with advanced machine tools
	level 4			firearm brought from the future

Technology
Metallurgy and Firearms (global troop offensive/defensive, higher tiers allow special firearm troops)
Agriculture and Medicine (increased tax revenue, reduced disease spread)
Literacy and Printing (faster technology spread and gain, possibly increased revolt risk)
Future Ideas and Philosophy (combat tactics)

Special Units
*primitive firearms could just boost effectiveness of infantry from province, doesn't need special troops
gunpowder - elite soldiers armed with advanced firearms, often mounted
Bombardiers - support troops manning bombards for use as siege weapons or artillery

Combat Tactics (restricted by American culture? or merely to units with lots of gunmen?)
Guerilla Tactics	(defensive, skirmish) ++gunpowder, +archers, +light_cav, +light_inf
Kill Zone			(stand fast, skirmish, change to melee) +++gunpowder, ++bombard, +archers, +pikemen, +heavy_inf
Breakthrough		(charge, melee) ++gunpowder, ++heavy_cav, ++horse_archers, -pikemen
Fire and Motion		(advance, melee) +++gunpowder, +heavy_inf, +light_cav
Infantry Square		(stand fast, melee) ++gunpowder, ++bombard, ++pikemen, +archers, -cavalry 
Disengage			(defensive, melee, change to skirmish) ++gunpowder, ++light_cav, +archers

at some point, the traveller attempts to acquire a landed title
-could be from serving his liege well, allowing him to request or be offered a county
	*various conditions must be met: liege with a high opinion of the traveller and land to give away, certain liege traits, etc.
	*performing high-tech "miracles" on behalf of the liege may speed this process up
	*may cause turmoil in the realm, as a foreigner with strange ideas is raised to the nobility
-the traveller could simply declare war on a weak realm, seizing a single county
	*traveller needs a lot of money for mercenaries, or a large retinue equipped with firearms
	*current liege likely to object if the target is within his realm, though a favored traveller might get away with it
	*liege may attempt to stop the war, even if it's against a non-vassal?

	
the workshop is the traveller's barony holding, which contains a number of high-tech "buildings"
-the source of many of the traveller's unique abilities
-some early buildings can be built very quickly, if the right items are at hand (generator)
-perhaps some advanced tech only be built outside the lab (i.e. if a landed title is also owned, could be destroyed in sieges)
-a medical bay, for healing injury/disease, improving health, and possibly reducing biological age
-a genetics lab, for applying beneficial genetic traits to offspring, possibly biowarfare
-a metallurgical workshop, for refining metals, improved weapons and armor for troops, prerequisite for other workshops?
-a mechanical workshop, for producing tools and machinery, includes lathe/cutters/extruders/drills/rollers/etc.
-an armory, for constructing firearms for advanced retinues (musketeers, gunpowder, sappers, cannons?)
-power generation, coal/wood fired boiler? water power? diesel running on whale/olive oil?
-library (electronic?), for storing a vast amount of modern knowledge, gains lots of tech points?
-agriculture lab, seed bank, modern crops and farming techniques
-communications, radio transmitters (a very limited number?) could allow a large demesne size
-historical mineral surveys/geological info, for long-term wealth generation

WORKSHOP BUILDINGS [most advanced buildings require the workshop no longer be hidden]
generator (requires generator, consumes parts to keep running)
	wind/water/coal dynamo (requires mechanical)
		electrification (requires smelter)
			illumination (requires laboratory, glassworks, precision machine shop)
aqueduct/sewer
	indoor plumbing (requires smelter, mechanical)
		water treatment (requires laboratory)
medical chamber (requires medical supplies)
	clinic (requires distillery)
		hospital (requires chemical, grand library, plumbing)
distillery
	chemical works (requires mechanical)
		laboratory (requires machine, electrification, grand library, glassworks)
smelter
	glassworks (requires chemical, mechanical)
mechanical shop
	machine shop (requires tool, electrification, smelter)
		precision machine shop (requires tool, electrification, computer, smelter)
library (helpful to spread knowledge among your followers, advancing tech rate?)
	grand library
		printing press (requires mechanical, paperworks)
armory (requires chemical, smelter, mechanical)
	arsenal (requires chemical, smelter, machine)
		headquarters (requires several radios, electrification)
drill grounds (requires armory)
	drill grounds
		drill grounds
			drill grounds (requires arsenal)
				drill grounds
					drill grounds (requires headquarters)
secret society (requires library)
	secret society (requires ascending levels of keep/town and intrigue)
		secret society
			secret society
				secret society
					secret society
modern crops (requires seed container)
	paperworks (requires chemical, mechanical)
		textile mill (requires machine, electrification)
		
NON-WORKSHOP BUILDINGS (for non-workshop castles)
radio outpost (once built, consumes a radio and a generator by event) [+retinue, +levy reinforce]
	gunpowder garrison


[removed] defensive bombards (requires arsenal)

possible extras:
deal with manuals as a cost to various things at some point, maybe by complicated events
*add to a variable with each building constructed, compare against total manuals (create manuals slowly)
add restrictions to certain buildings based on starting no_* character modifiers (society, library, drill)
add the "real landed title" restriction to many buildings
try to make workshop de jure capital of a county

high tier buildings can construct certain goods by event/decision when at workshop?
perhaps a rare event to use a low tier workshop to build tools(etc.) out of multiple parts
laboratory: medicine
machine shop (costs a part): tool, generator
laboratory + machine shop (costs a part): gun
precision machine shop: tool, part
laboratory + precision machine shop: gun, radio (costs a part)
printing press (needs computer too, and power): manuals


a new stage of the game begins once the traveller gains a landed title
-player should move the workshop into an existing castle, destroying the old workshop
	*disable most full scale castle workshop buildings until after this happens
	*moving the workshop in this way destroys the barracks, stables, and training grounds
-wandering should be restricted or removed
	*could be a regency while wandering?
	*could send agents rather than wandering personally
-if perceived to be an evil sorcerer, may face political or military consequences
	*liege or rival vassals may take political action against you
	*possibly some sort of special CB against you under specific circumstances
	*pope might excommunicate you, or call crusade against you
-establish a unique form of government, informed by modern ideas
	*would need to be a king or duke, with certain other requirements met
	*perhaps some form of autocratic, centralized merchant republic? no trade posts? designated heir?
	*possibly some way to discourage packing the whole country with your own dynasty?
	*county/duke titles appointed and revoked freely? events to make vassals into patricians somehow?
		!designate vassal with minor title, then destroy patrician and replace with designated vassal
		!event where vassal wishes to be raised to patrician, when a patrician house isn't landed
		!free_revoke_on_governments (feudal, tribal, nomad?)
	*certain decisions must be voted on by the other families
		!a crown law determines which decisions that other families get to vote on
		!limit aggressive wars, start a special type of war, declare vassal enemy of the state
		!establishing "orders" could require a vote?
	*a realm-wide "vote of no confidence" in the top liege can attempt to force him to abdicate
		!triggered by tyranny, known_murderer, and various bad traits
		!a period of campaigning and debate before the actual vote is tallied
		!if the vote succeeds, king can refuse to abdicate at the cost of additional tyranny (and civil war?)
		!refusal could unlock an additional faction that demands abdication
		!leader (or participants/voters?) of the vote might be vulnerable to punishment if the vote fails
-establish a unique new religion
	*probably a catholic heresy, or messianic jewish heresy
		-different possible religions that could be founded, with different qualities
		-depends on whether the traveller founds it or a descendant of his founds it
			!aggressive, traveller as final prophet, founder conquers on behalf of God as conservator of Earth
			!tolerant, no religious head (or not the secular ruler), learning bonus, affinity for university society
			!mystery cult, rituals and secret knowledge, control "tools of God", remain catholic (try to control pope?)
			!messianic, traveller was Christ (averted apoc by dying?), living people he met might convert, founder is head
			!pure cult of personality, wholly new religion discards many Christian rites in favor of "the leader"
	*reveres the original traveller as a saint, miracle worker, or even as Christ come again?
		-possibly some regard traveller as saint and some as divine, the important thing is that his authority supercedes the pope
	*founder could gain religious head title, "crusades" activated with certain conditions (religion size, MA?)

All Holy Orders
skills and traits of the captain determine effectiveness of the order
?orders cannot be held by secular kings, forcing the player to abdicate or destroy the holy order
?orders could be forced to give up duke/county titles to rightful owners (abdicate? destroy duke titles?)
?could also be forced to give up non-barony vassals
send non-landed relatives to various orders, or they can request opportunity to join
*returning relatives may gain traits, improve education, friend/rival/lover, or have other outcomes
*some relatives may wish to remain at the holy order permanently, succession disqual trait (and claim on order?)
could be events where orders come into conflict with each other, liege has to mediate
*order influence in each county could be handled by province modifiers, with various benefits

Order Formation
formation of each order has unique requirements, probably including new govt/religion to be formed
requires a courtier of American culture and high skill to set as initial captain
?require empty holding slots (in certain province(s)) in which to build a castle/city?

Order Succession - needs more research
goal is something akin to open elective + appointment
can a trait or claim qualify a courtier to inherit the holy order?
liege may get some say by event or diplomatic action (give people claims? thumbs up/down the new guy?)
?event where qualified courtier in an order seizes control of it (gains monk-equivalent trait?)
worst case, a set of events to manage an election within the order with interim open elective succession
*liege gets the option to pick between three best options, plus the current interim captain

Inquisitor <x> of The Illuminated Order (ordinem illuminata) [illuminatus]
a security/intelligence agency, informed by modern statecraft ideas
focused on intrigue and/or martial skill (castles), chartered to control tech mysteries
events related to assassination, imprisonment (rescuing?), fabricating treason, purging state enemies
used to defend against plots and other time travellers, serves as inquisitors and spies
crown law determines what tools are available to the liege
culture of absolute loyalty to the liege/religion head (event to kick out members with poor opinion of rel. head?)

Director <x> of The Golden Council (ordinem auriolus) [auriolus]
established to supervise and tax merchants, moneylenders, and trade guilds
focused on stewardship (city and trade posts?), provides loans to members of the realm (and beyond?)
charter includes keeping the roads safe and well maintained, escorts for pilgrims and merchants
runs a limited postal service, maintains maps and other navigational information
events related to annual windfall, reinvestment, overthrow foreign debtors, safety/revolt risk in a county
periodic events to add beneficial modifiers to counties, or gain money from already improved counties

Provost <x> of The University Society (ordinem cognitionis) [philosophus]
established to preserve, interpret, and diffuse knowledge (especially modern knowledge)
focused on learning and enlightenment values (builds cities or temples?)
young adults can be sent to study temporarily, in addition to courtiers joining the order as they do others
grants the Alumnus trait to a character that succeeds in his studies, with many possible outcomes
study results include better education, cynical trait, American culture, custom religion, Christian heresy, expelled/fail
crown law of liege changes society: foreigners?, all Christian?, nobles only?, intellectual independence? assimilation?
culture is "cynical," possibly a counterweight to a zealous religious head (the player)
may introduce a second custom Catholic heresy: possibly deistic, tolerant, pluralistic
events related to spreading technology, tolerance, literacy, preserving future tech, question wisdom of spreading tech
?temples instead of cities? conflict arises as university builds or acquires temples in land owned by others

(1) adoption of philosophical (mathematical-historical) reason as the only and exclusive criterion of what is true;
(2) rejection of all supernatural agency, magic, disembodied spirits, and divine providence;
(3) equality of all mankind (racial and sexual);
(4) secular ‘universalism’ in ethics anchored in equality and chiefly stressing equity, justice, and charity;
(5) comprehensive toleration and freedom of thought based on independent critical thinking;
(6) personal liberty of lifestyle and sexual conduct between consenting adults;
(7) freedom of expression, political criticism, and the press, in the public sphere.
(8) democratic republicanism as the most legitimate form of politics.

technologies that may spread
-the traveller can sell caches of firearms, which can be used by feudal rulers to raise a single musketeer retinue
	*at some point, feudal rulers may begin figuring out how to manufacture them 
	*controlling the secrets of metallurgy, machining, black powder/smokeless powder manufacturing
-modern or new world crops: corn, potatoes, tomatoes
-sanitation/germ theory, water purification
-improved steel smelting techniques
-modern accounting/management/administration ideas
-printing press/expanded literacy/enlightenment philosophy
