illuminatus;Illuminatus;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
illuminatus_desc;Followers of the Illuminatus tradition are devoutly loyal to the Traveller, who they regard as the second son of God. Many Illuminatus devote their lives to safeguarding the Traveller's descendants and possessions, described in hushed tones as the Tools of God. Illuminatus thought regards the preservation of technological secrets as a sacrament. Their mysteries can be complex to navigate, so rituals aid the faithful in purifying their minds of undesirable knowledge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
auriolus;Auriolus;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
auriolus_desc;Followers of the Auriolus tradition claim that prosperity is the will of God for all Christians. They believe divine inspiration revealed the details of the contract between God and humanity, linking spiritual wealth with material wealth and spiritual health with physical health. It is a common Auriolus belief that charity and tithes will be multiplied and returned to the donor, and that prosperity will come to those who uphold their end of the contract with God.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

On this subject they consider the Traveller the wisest and greatest sage ever to have lived, but just a man. In private some Philosophus may admit the same suspicions about Christ. The church frowns upon the Philosophus tolerance of heretical ideas, but that very openness to novelty may carry the seeds of an early Enlightenment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lanius;Lanius;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lanius_desc;Followers of the Lanius tradition accept the Traveller as the final prophet of God. They believe he was granted divine mandate to conquer Earth, and that a glorious apocalypse will occur when enough infidels are put to the sword. This day of judgment is inevitable, but the faithful act to accelerate its arrival as a sacred duty. The Lanius claim to love death more than their enemies love life, and in return their enemies regard them as butchers and mad dogs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
