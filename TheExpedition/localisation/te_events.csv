EVTNAME_start_arrive;Something Has Gone Wrong...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_start_arrive;The Expedition was not fully prepared for the device to activate, and yet it did. You saw your lab assistants smeared into threads of blinding violet light. Lab equipment and crates of supplies danced across the floor, disappearing into the vortex. Momentarily disoriented, you soon suffered the same fate.\n\nSomehow, you kept your wits about you. You know the device inside and out. You know how to steer it, how to choose its destination!\n\nAmid the chaos, you recognize the silhouette of Europe!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_start_rome;Guide it towards Rome!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_start_paris;Guide it towards Paris!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_start_london;Guide it towards London!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_start_koln;Guide it towards Koln!;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME_start_crash;The Arrival;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_start_crash;You maneuver the device through the temporal fracture, as blistering threads of reality coruscate around you. With no city lights and no beacon to guide you, you are unable to pinpoint the exact location of the city you're aiming for.\n\nThe ragged violet fracture belches you forth, along with the comatose bodies of your lab assistants and piles of smouldering lab equipment. From the last moments of your time within the temporal vortex, you believe you are somewhere in the forested hills of [Root.Location.GetName].\n\nYou hear the increasingly-high-pitched whine of flux circuits about to overload.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TXT_gonna_blow;A risk of being injured.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TXT_gonna_kill;A high risk of being injured.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_start_crash_heal;Drag your colleagues to safety!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_start_crash_scav;Gather the fragile supplies and instruments first.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_start_crash_repair;Disable the overloading machinery before it explodes.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_start_crash_run;It's gonna blow! Run for it!;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME_start_heal;Tending the Wounded;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_start_heal;You pull your injured and comatose colleagues away from the wreckage of the time machine. Their bodies are warm, but the black veins visible beneath their pallid skin does not bode well for their long term survival. None of them respond to your resuscitation attempts, as their glassy eyes roll back in their heads, but at least they're all stabilized.\n\nAs you tend to them, the whine of the overloading machinery becomes a shriek...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_start_uhoh;Uh oh...;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME_start_scav;Preserving the Expedition;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_start_scav;You quickly judge that healing your colleagues would be beyond your medical skill, and begin gathering the irreplaceable supplies and scientific instruments scattered around the arrival point.\n\nBefore the accident, The Expedition had prepared crates of gear for surviving in the past: guns and ammo, portable computers and diesel generators, technical and medical manuals, rugged machine tools, medical supplies, modern seeds, communications gear, and some small boxes of gold coins. Even the damaged items will be useful for spare parts.\n\nAs you gather the last armload, the whine of the overloading machinery becomes a shriek...;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME_start_repair;Damage Control;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_start_repair;The only way to ensure the survival of your colleagues and all the scientific equipment is to stop the explosion... and you choose to do so even though it puts you in great personal danger.\n\nFortunately, you're a scientific genius. Despite the blinding eye pain and the fabric of your work gloves melting to your fingertips, you manage to flip the correct breakers and yank out the correct wires. The whine subsides to a hum, then fades entirely.\n\nYou slump against the machine, exhausted and bleeding.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME_start_run;Run Away!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_start_run;You run to safety. Discretion is the better part of valor, right? You don't want to get killed by an exploding time machine. You can replace anything that gets destroyed or anyone who gets killed, but first you have to protect yourself.\n\nIn the distance, the whine of the overloading machinery becomes a shriek.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME_start_kaboom;Kaboom!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_start_kaboom;The device shudders, discharges a blinding spark, then detonates with a thunderous blast. Did it disappear to a different time, Or simply explode in place?\n\nThe pressure wave surges past you, accompanied by shrapnel that plinks off of rocks and tree trunks. You hear a continuous popping sound... electrical discharges, ammunition cooking off, or hearing damage?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_start_boom_ok;Nothing seems to be bleeding.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_start_boom_hurt;A sharp pain, and something warm seeping through your shirt.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME_start_after;The Aftermath;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_start_after;The immediate crisis is over, and you have a chance to recuperate and take stock of what resources survived the trip:\nBooting laptops: [Root.owned_computer.GetValue]\nFunctional firearms: [Root.owned_guns.GetValue]\nFunctional machine tools: [Root.owned_tools.GetValue]\nFunctional shortwave radios: [Root.owned_radios.GetValue]\nPortable generators: [Root.owned_generator.GetValue]\nIntact technical manuals: [Root.owned_manuals.GetValue]\nIntact medical crates: [Root.owned_medicine.GetValue]\nIntact seed containers: [Root.owned_seeds.GetValue]\nSalvaged spare parts: [Root.owned_parts.GetValue];;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPT_start_after_wound;I can patch this wound, at least temporarily.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_start_after_ok;I need to find shelter from the elements.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TXT_grab_gun;No reason not to grab a gun, just in case.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME_start_hunter;The Curious Hunter;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_start_hunter;You hear a rustling at the edge of the clearing and a local hunter emerges from the brush, his mouth agape at the scene. He whispers something in a language you don't comprehend, possibly medieval [Root.Location.Culture.GetName].\n\nThe hunter motions towards an outcropping overlooking the meadow, and when you shield your eyes and squint you see the mouth of a cave. He gestures towards you and then the cave, apparently offering to assist you.\n\nYou spot a deer among the trees, warily watching for predators...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_start_hunter_wounded;You hear a rustling at the edge of the clearing and a local hunter emerges from the brush, his mouth agape at the scene. He whispers something in a language you don't comprehend, possibly medieval [Root.Location.Culture.GetName].\n\nNoticing your wounds, the hunter motions towards an outcropping overlooking the meadow, and when you shield your eyes and squint you see the mouth of a cave. He gestures towards you and then the cave, apparently offering to assist you.\n\nYou spot a deer among the trees, warily watching for predators...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_start_hunter_wound;Normally I would refuse help, but I'm bleeding so much...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_start_hunter_kill;This hunter has seen too much. No witnesses.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_start_hunter_deer;I have this gun, and a deer will make a fine meal.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TXT_share_deer;This will impress the hunter with my awesome power.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_start_hunter_hire;A few coins, for his aid and his time.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TXT_hire_hunter;I need all the allies I can get to survive in this world.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_start_hunter_refuse;I don't need assistance from anyone.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME_start_workshop;The Workshop Established!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_start_workshop;Despite the lack of a shared language, you and the hunter easily move the salvaged technology and your dying colleagues into the cave before night fell. The cave is surprisingly dry, and it seems it will make a fine workshop and base of operations for now. You hope there are not too many people who know its location.\n\nThe hunter is fascinated by your strange objects. You cannot tell whether he views you as an odd foreign merchant, as a supernatural being come to Earth, or something else. You share some food, and begin to wonder whether you've acquired your first follower.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_start_workshop_wound;In your wounded state, you are lucky to have the assistance of the hunter despite the lack of a shared language. Without him, you would not have been able to move the salvaged technology and your dying colleagues into the cave before night fell. The cave is surprisingly dry, and it seems it will make a fine workshop and base of operations for now. You hope there are not too many people who know its location.\n\nThe hunter is fascinated by your strange objects. You cannot tell whether he views you as an odd foreign merchant, as a supernatural being come to Earth, or something else. You share some food, and begin to wonder whether you've acquired your first follower.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_start_workshop_alone;You struggle to move the salvaged technology and your dying colleagues into the cave before night falls. The cave is surprisingly dry, and it seems it will make a fine workshop and base of operations for now. You hope there are no other people who know its location.\n\nBefore night fell, you dragged the dead a distance from the cave. They will be buried tomorrow, assuming you can find a shovel. For now, you must eat and rest.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_start_workshop_hire;He seems like a trustworthy fellow.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_start_workshop_dismiss;I don't need this follower.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_start_workshop_plan;I must plan my next course of action...;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME_start_attitude;The First Week;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_start_attitude;You have finally begun to accept that this isn't all just a dream. For the last week you've gone to sleep expecting to awaken in your own bed, but it hasn't happened. You wake up in a medieval cave every morning, and you're going to have to deal with the reality of the situation. At least here you can see the stars.\n\nNone of your colleagues are responsive. Their eyes remain glassy, and their skin remains ashen and translucent with black veins ominously visible. Food is running low, and you're starting to feel a bit homesick and claustrophobic. You must take action if you are to survive.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_start_att_ally;At least my hunter companion keeps me company.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_start_att_plan;I already know exactly what I'll do here.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TXT_plan_lifestyle;You choose from four lifestyle traits: scholar, hedonist, stragegist, or impaler.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_start_att_kind;The Renaissance will come centuries early.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_start_att_cruel;None of these primitives will dare oppose me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_start_att_doomed;I'm doomed!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TXT_doomed;DOOMED! DOOOOOMED!!\n;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME_start_plan;The Moment Has Come!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_start_plan;You gaze at the pristine, cloudless night sky. The medieval world is your playground. You can finally make your impossible dreams come true!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_start_plan_learn;From a scientific perspective, an anthropological gold mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TXT_herds;Peasants. They DO move in herds!\n;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_start_plan_hedon;All the pleasures I've dreamed of. Wine. Opium. Harems.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_start_plan_strat;Alexander, Charlemagne, Napoleon... morons compared to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_start_plan_impale;Here, there are no police to stop my depraved crimes.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TXT_dark_pass;The Dark Passenger begins to gain control...\n;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME_start_religion;Man of Science, Man of Faith;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_start_religion;Religion plays a central role in medieval Europe. In the high energy temporal physics department, no one expected you to talk about your faith. In a land where the Pope can call twenty thousand crusaders to crush heretical enemies, it's a lot more relevant.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_start_relig_atheist;Religion is pure poppycock, but I'll still need to pretend.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_start_relig_cult;I'm really more of a cultural Catholic.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_start_relig_neut;The Bible contains a lot of wisdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_start_relig_zeal;Deus Vult! The holy spirit flows through me!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TXT_touch_of_time;Or is that a touch of time sickness?\n;;;;;;;;;;;;x

TXT_nothing_happens;nothing happens.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_wander_begin;You set out from your well-concealed workshop and laboratory. Although it is dangerous to travel the roads of medieval Europe, you must do so if you are to gather allies and resources.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_wander_leave;You inform [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] that you must take a brief hiatus from the duties of court, and set out to travel the roads of medieval Europe. It's dangerous, but you must do so if you are to gather allies and resources.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_wander_disband;Without your leadership, the exploration party has disbanded and your travelling companions have returned to your hidden workshop.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_wander_remove_expedition;With the acquisition of a landed title, it would no longer be seemly to present yourself as merely a traveller of The Expedition. You have established a noble dynasty!;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_country_nolang_market;You visit the countryside, perusing the goods at in a small market town. Though you don't understand the language well, you believe you could string enough words together to buy what you need.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_country_lang_market;You visit the countryside, perusing the goods at in a small market town. Merchants hawk wares of all kinds from their stalls: winesellers, fruit vendors, and bakers hawking warm buns all jostle for your attention.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_country_market_talk;Try to strike up a conversation with someone important.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_country_market_haggle;Buy some nice things, with a bit of haggling.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPT_country_tavern_drink;Have a drink, and a bit of fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_country_tavern_leer;Leer at the barmaid and wenches of ill-repute.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_country_tavern_observe;Observe the surrounding conversations quietly.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_country_tavern_brawl;Instigate a brawl.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_country_nolang_children;You come across a small group of peasant children playing along a country road. They speak an unfamiliar language amongst themselves, apparently interested in an unusual traveller walking near their homes.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_country_lang_children;You come across a small group of peasant children playing along a country road. They eagerly crowd around you and shout for you to tell them tales of the lands beyond their village. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_country_children_spook;Give them a scare, to teach them about strangers.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_country_children_kind;They live hard lives. This should help.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_country_children_talk;Engage them in conversation, and maybe learn a few words.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_country_children_story;Tell them some fanciful stories.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_country_children_ignore;Ignore them, to avoid angering their parents.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_country_nolang_angry;You must have done something wrong, because there are a bunch of angry men shaking pitchforks at you and yelling in an incomprehensible language. Did you talk to someone you shouldn't have? Did you cross the wrong insignificant patch of land?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_country_lang_angry;You must have done something wrong, because there are a bunch of angry men shaking pitchforks at you and yelling in the common tongue. Did you talk to someone you shouldn't have? Did you cross the wrong insignificant patch of land?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_country_angry_shoot;It may be loud, but I call it "The Silencer".;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_country_angry_diplo;Maybe I can make them see reason.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_country_angry_run;Run away!;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_country_nolang_arrest;Mounted men-at-arms accost you as you travel through the countryside. Their shields bear the coat of arms of [Root.Location.Holder.GetTitledFirstName], who rules this land. They shout orders at you, but you don't understand what they're saying.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_country_lang_arrest;Mounted men-at-arms accost you as you travel through the countryside. Their shields bear the coat of arms of [Root.Location.Holder.GetTitledFirstName], who rules this land. They shout for you to submit to them, and be punished for your crimes.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPT_country_arrest_innocent;I'm innocent! It must be someone else you're looking for!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_country_arrest_nolang;I'm innocent! But I don't speak their language...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_country_arrest_bribe;Perhaps a bit of gold will change their minds.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_country_arrest_run;You'll never catch me!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TXT_escape;escaping unscathed.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_country_arrest_surr;I'll go quietly.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME_country_nolang_learn;The Common Tongue;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_country_nolang_learn;You've always been quick to pick up languages. Your travels have immersed you in the local dialects, and you are rapidly becoming fluent. You finally feel as though you can communicate acceptably in normal conversation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_country_nolang_learn;The words come naturally.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_wander_beg;With funds running perilously low, you are put in a desperate position. Some principle must be broken.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPT_wander_bandit;Banditry.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_wander_erudite;Along the road, you meet a small group of men involved in an erudite debate about philosophy and the nature of the divine. It's unusual to hear such a frank discussion of ideas the church would consider heretical. Hundreds of years of philosophical thought might give you an advantage in such a conversation, and convince one of them to join your travels.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_wander_erudite_pilgrim;I'll impress the itinerant priest.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_wander_erudite_scribe;I'll impress the heretical scribe.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_wander_erudite_jew;I'll impress the eloquent Jewish mystic.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_wander_erudite_ignore;These men would be dangerous to travel with.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_workshop_begin;The hidden workshop is a place of safety, industry, and convalescence. With appropriate facilities constructed within it, you will be able to study and converse with your companions, produce valuable goods, and treat many injuries and diseases.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_workshop_leave;You inform [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] that you must take a hiatus from the duties of court to spend time in your workshop. You will study and converse with your companions, produce valuable goods, and treat any injuries and diseases that ail you.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_workshop_build_tool;While tinkering in your mechanical workshop you devise an ingenious way to use the parts you have available and a few things from the market to restore one of your damaged machine tools to working condition.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_workshop_build;It must be built!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_workshop_no;The parts would be better for something else.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_workshop_poor;I can't afford some essential components.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_workshop_brandy;With the distillery up and running in your workshop, producing brandy is a good source of income. Of course, quality has a major impact on how much merchants will be willing to pay.\n\nLet the good times flow!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_workshop_brandy_yes;I'll just test this batch...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_workshop_brandy_no;There are more important duties.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_workshop_brandy_lib;I'll be in the library instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_city_begin;Nothing else is quite like a medieval city. The sights, the sounds, and unfortunately... the smells. Despite the occasional unpleasantness there is no better place to buy and sell goods than the bustling markets of a major city.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPT_city_poor_other;I have other business in the city.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_city_buy_terr;No matter where you look or who you talk to, you simply cannot find any good deals in the [Root.Location.GetName] markets. There are still goods to be bought, they just all seem overpriced.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_city_buy_poor;You are having difficulty finding any good deals in the [Root.Location.GetName] markets. There are a variety of goods to buy, but you think you might be able to get a better deal.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_city_buy_okay;The [Root.Location.GetName] markets are full of savvy merchants, but you haggle some of them down to reasonable prices. You think you're getting a pretty good deal.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_city_buy_good;The [Root.Location.GetName] markets are full of savvy merchants, but you skillfully haggle them down to bargain prices. You think you're getting a deal on all available goods.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_city_buy_great;You are on the top of your negotiation game today. The merchants of the [Root.Location.GetName] markets must be desperate to sell because you're bargain basement prices.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME_combat_shoot;Take Aim!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_combat_shoot;An arrow glances off your armor as the battle is joined, the air fills with a flurry of battle cries, and you hear the ringing sound of steel on steel.\n\nYour foes surge towards you, and you raise your gun to single out a warrior leading the charge. Despite [From.GetPossPronoun] heavy mail and helmet, you recognize [From.GetTitledFirstName]. As the oblivious warrior notices the barrel trained on [From.GetObjectPronoun], you hold [From.GetPossPronoun] life in your hands.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_combat_shoot_depressed;Life is so beautiful... I... can't do it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_combat_shoot_spare;I... can't do it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_combat_shoot_hunt;Just a different type of prey.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
